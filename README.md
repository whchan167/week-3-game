# Hangman GAME
This Disney hangman game was developed using basic HTML/CSS and javascript code. The game was designed to 
let player guess the Disney movie which the title was hidden and replaced by underscore. When the player presses
the correct letter key corresponding to the letter in the title, the letter will be revealed above the underscore. If 
the letter pressed by the player is incorrect, the number of guesses will reduce by one. 

The player wins the game if he/she successfully guesses all letters in the title corrrectly without consuming all chances of guesses. Otherwise, the player losses the game.

Have fun playing with Disney hangman game. 
Cheer with all Disney fans
